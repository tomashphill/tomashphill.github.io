        Hello, welcome!
    </p>
    <p>
        My name is Tom√°s, and I'm a recent Data Science grad from Lambda School.

        I'm currently working through the textbook Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective and accompanying lectures from Carnegie Mellon University in order to establish a foundation for my programming and computery knowledge.

        Hopefully you stuck around and saw the homepage of this website. Each time it's loaded, it grabs an image from The Art Institute of Chicago's public API, and populates each "pixel" on the page corresponding to the image (I've left it up to chance whether or not some glitchiness occurs, making for some cool effects). If you want to see what image is rendered, click the button on the top left of the homepage, and if there is a title associated with the image, it'll be displayed on the bottom-most cells.
