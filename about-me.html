                Hello, welcome!
            </p>
            <p>
                My name is Tom√°s, and I'm a recent Data Science grad from Lambda School.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm currently working through the textbook Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective and accompanying
                lectures from Carnegie Mellon University in order to establish a foundation for my programming and
                computery knowledge.

                The eyes and mouths that flash by on the landing page are face landmarks pulled from images of portraits
                in the Rijksmuseum art collection. This was done using OpenCV for face landmark detection and HTML5
                canvas for clipping the desired features.

        <p>Well... It's been over a year since I've updated this and it looks like now is the time to do it. I've grown
            a lot since then and this website doesn't reflect the level that I am at now. Time to rip this apart and
            start something new!</p>
